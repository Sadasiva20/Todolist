 To-Do List App

This is a simple and efficient To-Do List application built using React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Remix as a full-stack framework for routing and data management. The app allows users to add, edit, delete tasks, and persist data across sessions.

Project Description

The To-Do List App is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It leverages **React** for building the user interface, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and Tailwind CSS for fast, responsive styling. The app uses Remix for dynamic routing and improved server-side rendering (SSR), optimizing performance and providing an excellent developer experience.

Key Features:
Add Tasks: Users can easily add new tasks to their to-do list.
Edit Tasks: Users can update existing tasks as needed.
Delete Tasks: Tasks can be deleted once they are completed or no longer needed.
Mark Tasks as Complete: Users can mark tasks as completed to visually distinguish them.
Persistent Data Storage: The tasks are stored in a database via the backend, ensuring they persist even after refreshing the page.
Responsive Design: The app looks great on both mobile and desktop devices, thanks to Tailwind CSS.
Remix plays a key role by handling server-side rendering, efficient data loading, and routing, improving both the app's performance and maintainability.

Features
Add Tasks: Add new tasks with just a click and a few keystrokes.
Edit Tasks: Update task descriptions directly in the list.
Delete Tasks: Remove unnecessary tasks with the click of a button.
Mark Tasks as Completed**: Toggle the completion status of tasks to visually indicate completed tasks.
Persistent Data: Tasks are saved in a database, making them available across app sessions.
Responsive UI: Tailored for both desktop and mobile views with Tailwind CSS.

Technologies Used

1. React:
   React is used to build the frontend of the application. It allows for a component-based architecture, enabling efficient rendering when tasks are added, edited, or deleted.
   Features: Component-based UI, state management with hooks, and dynamic re-rendering.

2. Node.js:
  Node.js is used as the runtime environment for the backend, with Remix handling both the frontend and backend routing, including API requests.
3. Remix:
    Remix is a modern full-stack framework for React that improves performance with server-side rendering (SSR), automatic data loading, and fast routing.
   Features: Nested routing, automatic code splitting, improved performance with SSR, and seamless data management.
 4. Tailwind CSS:
    Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for building custom designs quickly and responsively. It's used for styling the application with minimal custom CSS.
     Features: Utility classes for fast styling, customizable themes, and responsive design utilities.

8. TypeScript (ES6+):
    The app uses modern TypeScript features such as  async/await , arrow functions,  destructuring, and template literals for cleaner and more readable code.
